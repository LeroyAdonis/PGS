```

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 Onboarding**: No dependencies (can start after Foundation)
- **US2 Content Generation**: No dependencies (can start after Foundation)
- **US3 Automation**: Needs US2 (confidence scoring depends on content approval)
- **US4 Images**: No dependencies (can start after Foundation, integrates with US2)
- **US5 Billing**: No dependencies (can start after Foundation)
- **US6 Analytics**: Needs Publishing (Phase 9) complete
- **US7 Chat**: Can start anytime, but more valuable after core features exist

### Critical Path (MVP)

For fastest time to MVP:

1. Phase 1: Setup (required)
2. Phase 2: Foundational (required, blocking)
3. Phase 3: US1 Part 1 - Onboarding WITHOUT social (T043-T065)
4. Phase 4: US2 - Content Generation (T066-T091)
5. Phase 5: US1 Part 2 - Social OAuth (T092-T109)
6. Phase 9: Publishing (T154-T172)
7. Phase 8: US5 - Billing (T135-T153) - needed for revenue
8. Selected items from Phase 14: Polish

**MVP Delivery Point**: After Phase 9 + US5, you have: Onboarding ‚Üí Generate Content ‚Üí Connect Social ‚Üí Publish Posts ‚Üí Collect Payment

### Parallel Opportunities

All tasks marked **[P]** within a phase can execute in parallel:

**Phase 2 Foundational** - All migrations (T012-T022), all Zod schemas (T027-T031) can run in parallel

**Phase 3 US1** - API endpoints (T045-T050), UI pages (T051-T061) can run in parallel

**Phase 4 US2** - AI services (T066-T068), API endpoints (T070-T075), UI components (T078-T083) can run in parallel

**Multiple User Stories** - After Foundation, US1/US2/US5 can be developed in parallel by different developers

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Recommended Path)

**Week 1-2: Foundation**

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T009)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T010-T042)
3. **Checkpoint**: Database schema ready, auth working

**Week 3: Core MVP Features** 4. Phase 3: US1 Onboarding without social (T043-T065) 5. Phase 4: US2 Content Generation (T066-T091) 6. **Checkpoint**: Can onboard users and generate content

**Week 4: Publishing** 7. Phase 5: US1 Social OAuth (T092-T109) 8. Phase 9: Publishing Infrastructure (T154-T172) 9. **Checkpoint**: End-to-end flow working - content reaches social platforms

**Week 5: Revenue** 10. Phase 8: US5 Billing (T135-T153) 11. Essential polish from Phase 14 12. **Checkpoint**: MVP complete - can charge customers

**Total MVP Delivery**: ~5 weeks with 1-2 developers

### Incremental Delivery (Post-MVP)

**Iteration 2**: Add US3 Automation (Phase 6) + US4 Images (Phase 7)
**Iteration 3**: Add US6 Analytics (Phase 10) + Settings (Phase 12)
**Iteration 4**: Add US7 Chat (Phase 11) + Admin Panel (Phase 13)
**Iteration 5**: Complete Phase 14 Polish for production launch

### Parallel Team Strategy (2-3 Developers)

**Week 1-2**: All developers on Foundation together (Phase 1 & 2)

**Week 3-4**: Split work

- Developer A: US1 Onboarding + US5 Billing
- Developer B: US2 Content Generation + US3 Automation
- Developer C: US4 Images + Phase 9 Publishing

**Week 5+**: Integrate and polish

- All developers: Phase 14 Polish + Testing
- Rotate on US6, US7, Admin features

## Summary

**Total Tasks**: 270
**MVP Tasks**: ~120 (Phases 1-5, 8-9, essential Phase 14 items)

**Task Distribution by User Story**:

- **Setup & Foundation**: 42 tasks (T001-T042)
- **US1 Onboarding**: 29 tasks (T043-T065, T092-T109)
- **US2 Content Generation**: 26 tasks (T066-T091)
- **US3 Automation**: 12 tasks (T110-T121)
- **US4 Images**: 14 tasks (T122-T134)
- **US5 Billing**: 19 tasks (T135-T153)

- **Settings**: 13 tasks (T207-T219)
- **Admin Panel**: 15 tasks (T220-T234)
- **Polish**: 36 tasks (T235-T270)

**Parallel Opportunities**:

- 95 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phase
- 6 user stories (US1-US5 + Admin) can be worked on simultaneously after Foundation

**Independent Test Criteria per Story**:

- ‚úÖ Each user story has clear verification criteria
- ‚úÖ Each story delivers value independently
- ‚úÖ Each story can be tested without others

**MVP Scope**: Phase 1-5 + Phase 8-9 = Core value proposition (onboarding ‚Üí content generation ‚Üí social publishing ‚Üí billing)

**Suggested First Sprint**: T001-T042 (Setup + Foundation) = Solid base for all features

## Notes

- All paths are absolute and follow Next.js 15 App Router structure from plan.md
- Tests NOT included as they were not requested in spec.md
- Each user story is independently implementable and testable
- Tasks are sequenced to enable incremental delivery
- Checkpoint markers indicate natural stopping points for validation
- [P] tasks within a phase can be parallelized across team members
- User story organization enables MVP delivery after just US1 + US2 + Publishing + Billing
- Success Criteria (SC-001 through SC-010) from spec.md should be verified at final checkpoint
