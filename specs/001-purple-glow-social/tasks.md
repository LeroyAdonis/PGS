### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 Onboarding**: No dependencies (can start after Foundation)
- **US2 Content Generation**: No dependencies (can start after Foundation)
- **US3 Automation**: Needs US2 (confidence scoring depends on content approval)
- **US4 Images**: No dependencies (can start after Foundation, integrates with US2)
- **US5 Billing**: No dependencies (can start after Foundation)
- **US6 Analytics**: Needs Publishing (Phase 9) complete
- **US7 Chat**: Can start anytime, but more valuable after core features exist

### Critical Path (MVP)

For fastest time to MVP:

1. Phase 1: Setup (required)
2. Phase 2: Foundational (required, blocking)
3. Phase 3: US1 Part 1 - Onboarding WITHOUT social (T043-T065)
4. Phase 4: US2 - Content Generation (T066-T091)
5. Phase 5: US1 Part 2 - Social OAuth (T092-T109)
6. Phase 9: Publishing (T154-T172)
7. Phase 8: US5 - Billing (T135-T153) - needed for revenue
8. Selected items from Phase 14: Polish

**MVP Delivery Point**: After Phase 9 + US5, you have: Onboarding ‚Üí Generate Content ‚Üí Connect Social ‚Üí Publish Posts ‚Üí Collect Payment

### Parallel Opportunities

All tasks marked **[P]** within a phase can execute in parallel:

**Phase 2 Foundational** - All migrations (T012-T022), all Zod schemas (T027-T031) can run in parallel

**Phase 3 US1** - API endpoints (T045-T050), UI pages (T051-T061) can run in parallel

**Phase 4 US2** - AI services (T066-T068), API endpoints (T070-T075), UI components (T078-T083) can run in parallel

**Multiple User Stories** - After Foundation, US1/US2/US5 can be developed in parallel by different developers

- 95 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phase
- 6 user stories (US1-US5 + Admin) can be worked on simultaneously after Foundation

**Independent Test Criteria per Story**:

- ‚úÖ Each user story has clear verification criteria
- ‚úÖ Each story delivers value independently
- ‚úÖ Each story can be tested without others

**MVP Scope**: Phase 1-5 + Phase 8-9 = Core value proposition (onboarding ‚Üí content generation ‚Üí social publishing ‚Üí billing)

**Suggested First Sprint**: T001-T042 (Setup + Foundation) = Solid base for all features

## Notes

- All paths are absolute and follow Next.js 15 App Router structure from plan.md
- Tests NOT included as they were not requested in spec.md
- Each user story is independently implementable and testable
- Tasks are sequenced to enable incremental delivery
- Checkpoint markers indicate natural stopping points for validation
- [P] tasks within a phase can be parallelized across team members
- User story organization enables MVP delivery after just US1 + US2 + Publishing + Billing
- Success Criteria (SC-001 through SC-010) from spec.md should be verified at final checkpoint
