**Feature Branch**: `001-purple-glow-social`  
**Created**: October 8, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Purple Glow Social - AI Social Media Manager"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - SMB Owner Onboarding and Business Profile Creation (Priority: P1)

As a busy service-based SMB owner, I want to quickly onboard onto the platform and set up my business profile, so that the AI can understand my business context and start generating relevant content for my social media accounts.

**Why this priority**: This is foundational for the service as it captures essential business information required for relevant content generation. Without proper business context, the AI cannot generate appropriate content.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by walking through the onboarding flow and verifying that the business profile is created with all necessary information stored correctly. This delivers immediate value as users can see their business information properly represented in the system.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new SMB owner with valid credentials, **When** they complete the sign-up process, **Then** they should be directed to the onboarding wizard
2. **Given** a user in the onboarding wizard, **When** they input all required business information and submit, **Then** a complete business profile should be created and stored
3. **Given** a user who has entered business information, **When** they upload their logo and select brand colors, **Then** these assets should be properly stored and associated with their account
4. **Given** a user who has completed the onboarding wizard, **When** they link their social media accounts, **Then** the accounts should be successfully connected with proper OAuth permissions

### User Story 2 - AI Content Generation and Approval (Priority: P1)

As an SMB owner, I want the AI to generate culturally relevant content in my chosen language and tone, which I can review and approve before publishing, so that my social media maintains a consistent brand voice while requiring minimal effort from me.

**Why this priority**: This represents the core value proposition of the platform - reducing the time SMB owners spend on social media management while ensuring relevant, high-quality content.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that the AI generates content based on business profile information and that users can review, edit, and approve this content. This delivers the primary value of saving time while maintaining brand control.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has completed onboarding, **When** they access the dashboard for the first time, **Then** they should see AI-generated content ready for approval based on their subscription tier
2. **Given** a user viewing generated content, **When** they approve a post, **Then** it should be scheduled according to the optimal posting time
3. **Given** a user viewing generated content, **When** they edit a post and approve it, **Then** the AI should learn from these edits to improve future content
4. **Given** a user who selects a specific language and tone, **When** content is generated, **Then** it should reflect the selected language and incorporate appropriate cultural references

### User Story 3 - Automated Posting and Confidence Score (Priority: P2)

As an SMB owner who consistently uses the platform, I want the system to learn from my preferences and eventually post automatically without requiring manual approval, so that social media management becomes even more hands-off over time.

**Why this priority**: This enhances the core value proposition by further reducing user effort as the system learns, but it's dependent on the initial content generation and approval flow being established first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating user approval patterns over time and verifying that the confidence score increases appropriately, eventually enabling automatic posting. This delivers increased value through time-saving automation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user who regularly approves posts without edits, **When** the AI's confidence score reaches the threshold, **Then** the user should be prompted to enable automatic posting
2. **Given** a user who has enabled automatic posting, **When** new content is generated, **Then** it should be automatically scheduled without requiring manual approval
3. **Given** a user with automatic posting enabled, **When** they want to regain manual control, **Then** they should be able to toggle the automation setting off

### User Story 4 - AI Image Generation and Brand Integration (Priority: P2)

As an SMB owner, I want the platform to automatically generate visually appealing images that incorporate my brand elements for social media posts, so that my content stands out and maintains brand consistency.

**Why this priority**: Visual content significantly increases engagement on social media platforms, making this an important but not critical feature compared to text content generation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that the system generates images incorporating user-provided brand elements and that these images can be included in social media posts. This delivers value through enhanced visual presence without graphic design effort.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with a complete brand profile including logo and colors, **When** a post requiring an image is generated, **Then** the system should create a relevant image incorporating brand elements
2. **Given** a generated image, **When** the user approves it, **Then** it should be attached to the corresponding social media post
3. **Given** a generated image, **When** the user rejects it, **Then** the system should generate an alternative image or allow the user to upload their own

### User Story 5 - Subscription Management and Billing (Priority: P2)

As an SMB owner, I want to easily manage my subscription tier, billing information, and payment methods, so that I can control costs and adjust services as my business needs change.

**Why this priority**: While essential for business operations, this is not part of the core value proposition but necessary for sustainable service delivery.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that users can view, modify, and upgrade/downgrade subscription plans with appropriate billing updates. This delivers value through flexible service management.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user on the free trial, **When** the trial period ends, **Then** they should be automatically billed according to their selected plan
2. **Given** a user on any subscription tier, **When** they upgrade their subscription, **Then** they should immediately gain access to the new tier's features with prorated billing
3. **Given** a user who wants to downgrade, **When** they select a lower tier, **Then** the change should take effect at the end of their current billing cycle
4. **Given** a user who wishes to cancel their subscription, **When** they complete the cancellation process, **Then** their service should continue until the end of the current billing period

---

### User Story 6 - Analytics Dashboard (Priority: P3)

As an SMB owner, I want to view engagement metrics and performance analytics for my social media posts, so that I can understand what content resonates with my audience and adjust my strategy accordingly.

**Why this priority**: While valuable for optimization, this is not essential for the core function of content generation and publishing.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that the system collects and displays relevant engagement metrics from connected social platforms. This delivers value through data-driven insights.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with published posts, **When** they view the analytics dashboard, **Then** they should see engagement metrics for each post across all connected platforms
2. **Given** a user viewing analytics, **When** they select a specific time period, **Then** the dashboard should update to show data for only that period
3. **Given** a user with multiple social platforms connected, **When** they filter analytics by platform, **Then** they should see metrics specific to the selected platform

---

### User Story 7 - CopilotKit Chat Assistant for Natural Language Commands (Priority: P3)

As an SMB owner, I want to use natural language commands via a chat interface to manage content and settings, so that I can quickly make changes without navigating through multiple menus.

**Why this priority**: This provides an alternative interface that enhances user experience but is not critical to core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that the chat interface correctly interprets and executes natural language commands. This delivers value through improved efficiency and accessibility.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user at the dashboard, **When** they type "Generate three posts about our winter special" in the chat interface, **Then** the system should create three draft posts about winter promotions
2. **Given** a user who wants to analyze performance, **When** they ask "Show me my most engaging posts from last month" in chat, **Then** the system should display relevant posts sorted by engagement
3. **Given** a user who wants to modify content tone, **When** they command "Change the tone of scheduled posts to be more humorous", **Then** the system should adjust the tone of pending posts accordingly

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user's social media platform revokes OAuth access? System must detect access issues, notify the user, and pause posting to affected platforms until access is restored.
- How does system handle content generation for niche industries with limited reference data? System should request more specific information from users and adjust confidence scores accordingly.
- What happens when a user exceeds their subscription tier's content limits? System should notify the user and provide clear upgrade options without service interruption.
- How does system handle failed image generation? System must provide alternatives or default to text-only posts with appropriate notification to users.
- What happens during service downtime or API outages? System should maintain a queue of scheduled posts and attempt to publish when service is restored.
